  <h1>Richmond Airlift</h1>

  <h2>Who We Are</h2>

  <p>
    Richmond Airlift is a small, community focused effort to help our neighbors during a time of widespread uncertainty.
    You all know what we are talking about. For many people right now, leaving the house is unsafe and scary.
  </p>

  <p>
    The goal is simple. Neighbors ask for help with everyday but essential tasks like grocery pickup, pharmacy runs,
    basic errands, or getting supplies. Helpers step in to quietly and safely make that happen.
  </p>

  <p>
    We intentionally keep groups small. When a group starts getting too large, this setup allows us to create new groups
    and keep things decentralized. If that becomes necessary, contact an admin and they will help guide you through how
    to do that. We are doing this because our neighbors need support and we have the means to provide it.
  </p>

  <p>
    We will try to communicate in English as much as possible, but many of our neighbors may not speak it.
    It is a very good idea to get comfortable using a translator app on your phone when needed.
  </p>

  <h2>Tools</h2>

  <p>
    Helpers and neighbors communicate only through Signal. We use Signal because it is end to end encrypted,
    minimizes data collection, and gives us tools to protect privacy and identities.
  </p>

  <p>
    Signal can be used on:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>iOS (iPhone)</li>
    <li>Android</li>
    <li>Windows desktop</li>
    <li>macOS</li>
    <li>Linux</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Using one secure tool keeps communication simple, consistent, and safer for everyone involved.
  </p>

  <h2>Usernames</h2>

  <p>
    For this group, helpers must use a Signal username that clearly identifies them as a helper.
    The format should be:
  </p>

  <div class="note">
    <strong>the + a name of your choosing</strong><br />
    Examples: <em>thealex</em>, <em>thejordan</em>, <em>thechris</em>
  </div>

  <p>
    This ensures helpers are easily identifiable and helps prevent someone from presenting themselves as a helper
    when they should not be. Everyone should stay alert and pay attention to who is joining the group.
    If something feels off, raise it.
  </p>

  <p>
    When inviting new helpers, it is critically important that they and their households share the same values we do.
    This effort only works if neighbors are safe. Share this only with people you absolutely trust.
    The point is to fly below the radar, not to spread this far and wide.
  </p>

  <h3>Setting Up Signal</h3>

  <ul>
    <li>Download Signal:
      <ul>
        <li><a href="https://signal.org/download/" target="_blank">https://signal.org/download/</a></li>
        <li>Available on the iOS App Store and Google Play Store</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Sign up using your phone number</li>
    <li>Go to Signal Settings and set your username using the format above</li>
    <li>In Privacy settings, enable options so others see your username instead of your phone number</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Task Process</h2>

  <p>
    A neighbor will post a request in the group using a simple template describing what they need.
    No identifying information is included at this stage.
  </p>

  <p>
    A helper signals their intention to take the task using an emoji reaction.
    That helper then starts a direct message with the neighbor.
  </p>

  <p>
    Only in the direct message are details discussed.
    Addresses or identifying information are shared only at that point.
    Once the task is complete, the neighbor is safe and supported.
  </p>

  <p>
    Helpers are strongly encouraged to enable disappearing messages when speaking with a neighbor.
    This reduces long term data exposure and helps protect everyone involved.
  </p>

  <h2>Become a Helper</h2>

  <p>
    To be added as a helper, message all of our admins using the buttons below.
    Please click each button and send the message to each admin so your request is seen as quickly as possible.
  </p>

    You can copy and paste this message:
    <br />
    <em>"I would like to help with the Richmond Airlift."</em>

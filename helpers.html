      <h2>Who We Are</h2>
      <p>
        Richmond Airlift is a small, community-based effort to help our neighbors
        during a time of widespread uncertainty. You know what we are talking
        about.
      </p>
      <p>
        For many people, leaving the house right now feels unsafe and scary.
        We help neighbors stay in their homes while still getting everyday
        things done. This includes grocery and supply pickups, prescriptions,
        walking dogs, shoveling snow, mowing grass, and other basic household
        needs.
      </p>
      <p>
        We keep groups intentionally small. When a group becomes too large,
        new groups can be formed so coordination stays simple and safer for
        everyone involved. If you think a new group is needed, contact an admin
        to talk through how that can happen.
      </p>
      <p>
        Neighbors are people requesting help. Helpers are people offering their
        time and effort. We are doing this because our neighbors need support
        and we are in a position to provide it.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Tools</h2>
      <p>
        Helpers and neighbors communicate only through Signal.
      </p>
      <p>
        Signal is an end-to-end encrypted messaging app that limits data
        collection and reduces exposure of personal information. It is
        available on iOS, Android, Windows, macOS, and Linux.
      </p>
      <p>
        We will communicate in English as much as possible. Many neighbors may
        not speak English or may not speak it comfortably. Helpers are strongly
        encouraged to become familiar with a translation app so communication
        remains clear and respectful.
      </p>
      <p>
        Trust is essential. Only invite helpers who you trust completely and
        whose household shares the same values around safety, discretion, and
        respect. This is meant to stay quiet and low-profile. Do not share this
        widely. Share it only with people you would trust without hesitation.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Usernames</h2>
      <p>
        To make helpers easy to identify and to protect neighbors, we use a
        consistent username format.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>For this group, helper usernames must follow this format:</strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><code>the</code> + a name of your choosing</li>
        <li>You may use your real name or a chosen name</li>
        <li>Examples: <code>theAlex</code>, <code>theRiver</code>,
          <code>theJordan</code></li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        This makes it clear who is a helper and helps prevent someone from
        presenting themselves as a helper when they should not be. Everyone
        should remain alert and speak up if something feels wrong.
      </p>

      <h3>Setting Up Signal</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Download Signal from
          <a href="https://signal.org/download/" target="_blank">signal.org/download</a>
          or your app store.
        </li>
        <li>
          Create your account using your phone number. You do not need to share
          this number with others.
        </li>
        <li>
          Set your username under Settings, then Profile, then Username.
        </li>
        <li>
          Adjust privacy settings so people see your username and not your phone
          number.
        </li>
        <li>
          When sharing your contact link, generate the link inside the Signal
          app and use that link.
        </li>
      </ol>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Task Process</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          A neighbor posts a request using a shared template. No identifying
          information is included.
        </li>
        <li>
          A helper reacts with an emoji to show they are taking the task.
        </li>
        <li>
          The helper starts a direct message with the neighbor.
        </li>
        <li>
          In the direct message, set disappearing messages to one week using the
          chat settings in Signal.
        </li>
        <li>
          Only after that are details like addresses or lists shared.
        </li>
        <li>
          The helper completes the task so the neighbor can remain safe at home.
        </li>
      </ol>

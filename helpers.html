      <h2>Who We Are & What We’re Doing</h2>
      <p>
        Richmond Airlift is a small, community-driven effort to help our
        neighbors during a time of widespread uncertainty. You all know what
        we’re talking about.
      </p>
      <p>
        For many people, leaving the house right now isn’t overwhelming —
        it’s unsafe and scary. Our goal is to make it possible for neighbors
        to stay in their homes while still getting essential things done.
      </p>
      <p>
        We intentionally keep groups small. If a group grows too large, this
        system is designed so new groups can be formed easily. Decentralization
        isn’t a buzzword here — it’s how we reduce risk, avoid bottlenecks, and
        make sure no single person or group becomes a point of failure. Helpers
        are encouraged to spin up new groups as needed.
      </p>
      <p>
        In this project, <strong>neighbors</strong> are people requesting help.
        <strong>Helpers</strong> are people volunteering their time and effort
        to provide that help. We’re doing this because our neighbors need
        support — not because we’re happy about the circumstances that make
        this necessary.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>What Helpers Are Signing Up For</h2>
      <p>
        Helpers communicate <strong>only through Signal</strong>. Signal is an
        end-to-end encrypted messaging app that minimizes data collection and
        allows people to participate without exposing personal information.
        This helps protect both helpers and neighbors.
      </p>
      <p>
        The structure is intentionally flat. There is no central authority
        managing every interaction. With that comes responsibility: helpers
        should be thoughtful, cautious, and intentional about who they add.
        Anyone added as a helper should be beyond reproach. Our neighbors’
        safety is the top priority.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Helper Usernames</h2>
      <p>
        To keep conversations clear and to protect neighbors, helpers use a
        consistent Signal username format.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Helper usernames should be:</strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><code>the + a name of your choosing</code></li>
        <li>You may use your real name or a chosen name</li>
        <li>Examples: <code>theAlex</code>, <code>theRiver</code>,
          <code>theJordan</code></li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        This makes it easy for neighbors to identify helpers in the group
        without exposing phone numbers or other personal details.
      </p>
      <p>
        In Signal, you can set this by going to
        <strong>Settings → Profile → Username</strong>. Be sure to generate and
        share your username link from inside the Signal app if needed.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>How the Signal Group Works</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          A neighbor posts a request to the Signal group using a shared
          template (name, task, general area, timing, etc.). No identifying
          information is included at this stage.
        </li>
        <li>
          A helper indicates they are taking the task by reacting to the
          message with an emoji.
        </li>
        <li>
          The helper then starts a direct message with the neighbor to work
          out details privately.
        </li>
        <li>
          Only in the private message are specific details shared, such as an
          address or grocery list.
        </li>
        <li>
          The helper completes the task, allowing the neighbor to stay safely
          at home.
        </li>
      </ol>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Join as a Helper</h2>
      <p>
        To be added as a helper, message multiple admins so your request is
        seen as quickly as possible.
